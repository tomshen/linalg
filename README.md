linalg
======

Basic linear algebra library written in C

Planned features
----------------
* ~~Matrices (as 2-dimensional arrays)~~
* ~~Vectors (as *n* by 1 or 1 by *n* matrices)~~
    * ~~Normalize~~
    * ~~Dot (inner) product~~
* ~~Basic operations~~
    * ~~Addition~~
    * ~~Subtraction~~
    * ~~Multiplication~~
* ~~Basic classification~~
    * ~~Symmetric~~
    * ~~Orthogonal~~ (needs testing)
* Useful operations
    * ~~Transpose~~
    * ~~Gaussian elimination~~
    * Inversion (Gauss-Jordan)
    * Determinant (gaussian elimination, take product of diagonal entries)
    * QR decomposition (and least squares regression)
* Input
    * Processing matrices from the command line
    * Processing matrices from a file
* Output
    * ~~Outputting to stdout~~
    * Outputting to a file
